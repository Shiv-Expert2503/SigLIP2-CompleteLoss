# Proof-of-Concept: Implementing the Complete SigLIP2 Loss for Hugging Face Transformers üéØ

This repository serves as a public workshop and proof-of-concept for implementing the complete, paper-accurate loss function for the **SigLIP2** model.

The goal is to address the feature gap identified in [**Hugging Face `transformers` Issue #40798**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/40798), where the current SigLIP2 implementation is missing the `SILC/TIPS` and `LocCa` loss components.

## **Estimated timeline:**
- Phase 1 (Research & Planning): 2-4 days
 
- Phase 2 (Implementation & Debugging): 5-10 days
 
- Phase 3 (Testing & Validation): 2-3 days

##  Current Status

- LocCa LOSS (Research ongoing)
- Day-2

## Development Roadmap 

This project will be completed in the following phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Research & Design** (Current)
    * Deeply study the key research papers to understand the "Parallel Prediction" mechanism.
    * Design the architecture for the Autoregressive (AR) Decoder based on the paper's specifications.
    * Document key insights and the final design approach.

2.  **Phase 2: Implementation**
    * Build the custom AR Decoder as a `torch.nn.Module`.
    * Implement the `LocCa` (Localization-aware Captioning) loss function, which will use the output of the AR Decoder.
    * Integrate all three loss components (`Sigmoid`, `SILC/TIPS`, `LocCa`) into a single, unified `SigLIP2Loss` module.

3.  **Phase 3: Validation**
    * Perform a smoke test on a small subset of the COCO dataset.
    * The goal is to validate that the complete end-to-end pipeline is functional, computes a loss, and that the loss value decreases over a few training steps, confirming that gradients are flowing correctly.

## Validation Scope & Hardware Constraints

This implementation is developed and validated on a single GPU (NVIDIA Tesla T4 via Google Colab). The primary goal is to create a **functionally correct, proof-of-concept implementation** of the complete SigLIP2 loss function.

The validation tests are performed on a small subset of the COCO dataset to ensure the end-to-end pipeline is operational. 

<!-- Further scaling and performance validation on production-level hardware and full datasets will be required for complete research reproducibility. -->
